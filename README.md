## Tests

Tests were run using Jest for each of the app's classes (Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern) to validate that the contructors stored properties on objects correctly and that the methods were set up correctly. All tests for these classes pass.

To test, install Jest and run npm test.

You can find the 4 files for the tests in the tests folder.
